            <p> Hi, Im Luis Rios, My passions are in Tech, Marketing, and Networking. </p>
            <p> I am a student in Los Angeles Pierce College and persuing a degree in Computer Science.
                This year I am working in getting a certificate in <span>AWS and Cybersecurity</span>.
            </p>
            <p> Growing up I was surrounded with small family owned buisnesses and with the world constantly advancing with tech and software
                we had to adjust to also going online. This made me get a knowledge in <span>basic IT</span> questions. As well,
                as having to make simple web pages for little buisnesses. This introduced me to explore the tech, software and ultimatley it becoming my carrer
                and major.
            </p>
            <p> Some of the projects I have done is created a website for a small Dog grooming Buisness 
                using WordPress. My Roll was to add an <span> online booking genterator</span>. That is now up and running.
                In my free time I spend my time doing simple coding games to impove my skills. One of my coding projects are 
                a commputerized online gambling game using <span> C++</span> .
            </p>
            <p> The tech industry is constantly changing and evolving regularly. Correlation to this, One field that has caught my eye is in education. I believe the education field has recently 
                had to change the most during these unexpected times facing a big impact due to the pandemeic. I have been researching this topic and one thing I discoverd
                is the traditional education system is not as effective as it was before. The world is constantly changing and the way we learn things has to change with it. A project I wish to work on is 
                one that can help students be able to learn material that is up to date in a new way from the traditional standard.
